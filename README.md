<h2>ğŸ’¡Inspiration - </h2>

<p>We are trying to develop a web applicaiton that would be sort of Red Bus but has a cool and simple UI interface. The main problem we are trying to solve is that even though most of the ticket booking websites are popular, their UI seems to be very complex and not user friendly. That's when the application of our software comes into the picture. We are trying to build a web application that not only has a simple UI but also provides best suggestions to the user based on his/her search.</p>
